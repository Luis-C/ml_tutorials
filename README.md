# Applied Machine Learning Tutorials

This repo contains a series of notebooks used to aid in talks I gave at the IT Security Lab at Virginia Tech on applied machine learning. All scripts are written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Heavy use was made of the Scikit-Learn library. Since these were applied talks, I didn't go into details on how to actually implement the algorithms. Regarding theory, I assume no background other than being able to read algebraic equations and some basic linear algebra. Any explicit use of probability theory is generally avoided since some may lack background in that material. I do assume that readers are familiar with Python and programming in general.

The tutorials are intended to be read in the order the talks were given, which are
1. Background
2. Classification with Scikit-Learn
3. Regression with Scikit-Learn
4. Unsupervised Learning with Scikit-Learn

More tutorials will be added as more talks are given.
