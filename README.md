# Applied Machine Learning Tutorials

This repo contains a series of notebooks used to aid in talks I'm giving for the IT division at Virginia Tech on applied machine learning. All scripts are written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Heavy use was made of the Scikit-Learn library. Since these were applied talks, I didn't go into details on how to actually implement the algorithms. Regarding theory, I assume no background other than being able to read algebraic equations and some basic linear algebra. Any explicit use of probability theory is generally avoided since some may lack background in that material. I do assume that readers are familiar with Python and programming in general.

The tutorials are intended to be worked through in the order the talks were given, which are
1. Background
2. Classification
3. Regression
4. Dimensionality Reduction
5. Clustering
6. Supervised Anomaly Detection and Unbalanced Data
7. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
8. Text Classification
8. Time Series Basics
9. Machine Learning with Time Series Data

More tutorials will be added as more talks are given.
